# Frontend UI Engineering Guidelines

**Category**: frontend, engineering
**Applies to**: claude, gemini, cursor, copilot, any
**Version**: 1.0.0

**Overview**
Frontend code touches every user. Poor UI engineering causes accessibility barriers, performance degradation, and broken experiences on non-standard devices. This skill enforces the discipline of building UI that works for everyone.

## When to Use
- Building any user-facing UI component
- Reviewing frontend PRs
- Before any UI ships to production

## Process

### Step 1: Accessibility First
- Every interactive element has a visible focus state.
- All images have meaningful `alt` text (or `alt=""` for decorative).
- Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text.
- All functionality operable by keyboard alone.
- Use semantic HTML: `<button>` not `<div onclick>`, `<nav>` not `<div class="nav">`.
- **Verify**: Run axe DevTools or Lighthouse accessibility audit. Score ≥ 90.

### Step 2: Performance (Core Web Vitals)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s**: Optimize images, preload critical resources.
- **FID/INP < 100ms**: Avoid long tasks on the main thread.
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1**: Reserve space for dynamic content.
- Lazy load below-the-fold images and non-critical JS.
- Bundle size: measure before and after. No unneeded dependencies.
- **Verify**: Lighthouse performance score ≥ 80. CWV within targets.

### Step 3: Responsive Design
- Test at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px viewports.
- No horizontal scrolling at any standard viewport.
- Touch targets ≥ 44px × 44px.

### Step 4: State Management Discipline
- Server state vs. client state are separate concerns — don't mix.
- No prop drilling more than 2 levels — use context or state management.
- Loading, error, and empty states handled for every async operation.
- **Verify**: Loading, error, and empty states all visible in Storybook/dev environment.

## Common Rationalizations (and Rebuttals)

| Excuse | Rebuttal |
|--------|----------|
| "Accessibility is for edge cases" | 1 in 4 adults has a disability. It's not an edge case. |
| "We'll optimize performance later" | Users leave after 3 seconds. "Later" is too late. |
