# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guidelines

**Category**: test
**Applies to**: claude, gemini, cursor, copilot, any
**Version**: 1.0.0

**Overview**
TDD is the discipline of writing a failing test *before* writing implementation code. It forces you to think about the interface before the internals, produces tests that actually test behavior (not just coverage), and gives you a safety net for every refactor.

AI agents skip tests constantly. This skill makes tests non-optional.

## When to Use
- Starting any new feature or function
- Fixing any bug (write a test that reproduces the bug first)
- Refactoring existing code (ensure test coverage before you start)

---

## Process

### Step 1: Write a Failing Test (Red)
Write a test for the behavior you want — before writing implementation.
- The test should describe what the code does, not how:
  - ✅ `test("returns 404 when user not found")`
  - ❌ `test("calls findById with the user id")`
- Run the test. Confirm it fails for the right reason (not a syntax error — a missing implementation).
- **Verify**: Test runs and fails with a clear "not implemented" or "undefined" error.

### Step 2: Write Minimum Code (Green)
Write the minimum implementation to make the test pass.
- Do not write more than the test requires — resist the urge to add logic for future cases.
- Run the test. Confirm it passes.
- **Verify**: All tests pass. No new tests added yet.

### Step 3: Refactor (Refactor)
Now clean up the implementation — no new behavior, only improved structure.
- Run tests after every refactoring step — do not batch refactors.
- If tests break during refactor: revert immediately, refactor more carefully.
- **Verify**: Tests still pass after refactor. Code is cleaner.

### Step 4: Repeat for Each Behavior
- Repeat steps 1–3 for each distinct behavior of the feature.
- Test pyramid: many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal end-to-end tests.

### Step 5: Coverage Sanity Check
Run coverage report. Flag any critical paths with 0% coverage.
- Do NOT chase a coverage number — write tests for behaviors that matter.
- **Verify**: All happy paths and key edge cases have tests. Coverage report reviewed.

## Common Rationalizations (and Rebuttals)

| Excuse | Rebuttal |
|--------|----------|
| "I'll add tests after" | After never comes. And after-the-fact tests test your implementation, not the behavior. |
| "This code is too simple to test" | Simple code breaks in unexpected ways when requirements change. |
| "Integration tests are enough" | Unit tests catch bugs faster, run faster, and localize failures better. |
| "We don't have time for TDD" | You have time for the bug investigation that comes without TDD? |

---

## Red Flags 🚩
- Tests were written *after* the implementation
- Tests test internal implementation details (private methods, DB queries) rather than behavior
- "Happy path only" test coverage
- Tests pass even when you break the implementation (mocked away the real behavior)
- Coverage target hit by testing trivial getters/setters

---

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Tests written before implementation (or alongside for bug fixes)
- [ ] Each test describes a specific behavior
- [ ] Red-green-refactor cycle followed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Key edge cases covered (empty input, null, boundary values)
- [ ] Coverage report reviewed for critical path gaps
