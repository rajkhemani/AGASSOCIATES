# AG Associates — Production Deployment Playbook

**Target architecture:** one Linux VPS, Docker Compose, Caddy reverse proxy with auto-TLS, Supabase Cloud for Auth, Groq/Gemini for LLM.

Optimized for: lowest cost, fastest path to "live", full orchestration (CI deploys, automated backups). RTO ≈ 1 hour from a restic snapshot.

> **Why not Cloud Run / Vercel?** That managed-cloud path is documented in the appendix at the end of this file. Use it once bank traffic justifies the cost.

## 0. The marketing site is a separate target

`advadiityagade.com` is **not** served from the VPS. It is the static export of
`apps/web`, published to GitHub Pages by
[`.github/workflows/nextjs.yml`](.github/workflows/nextjs.yml) on every push to
`main`. Nothing in the rest of this playbook applies to it.

### GitHub Pages must stay on the "GitHub Actions" source

In **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, `Source` must be
**`GitHub Actions`**. If it is ever set back to `Deploy from a branch`, GitHub
enables its built-in Jekyll builder, which builds the **repository root** and
publishes that to the same custom domain. Two publishers then compete and the
last writer wins.

This has happened twice in production. Both times the live site was replaced by
`README.md` rendered as a Jekyll page, titled `AGASSOCIATES` because there is no
`_config.yml` to override the default. On the first occurrence the two deploys
finished one second apart:

```
Next.js deploy finished : 13:11:40Z
Jekyll  deploy finished : 13:11:41Z   ← won
```

The second occurrence was worse, because the branch source had been pointed at a
feature branch rather than `main` — so every push to that working branch took
the production site down until the Actions workflow was re-run by hand.

Notes for whoever hits this next:

- **A healthy HTTP 200 is not proof the site is up.** The Jekyll page serves
  perfectly well; it is simply the wrong site. Check the `<title>` — the real
  site is `AG Associates — Banking Panel Advocates, Thane`.
- **`.nojekyll` does not fix it.** That disables Jekyll *processing*, not the
  branch-based deployment. The root would still be published, just unrendered.
- **To recover**, re-run the Pages workflow manually — Actions → *Deploy Next.js
  site to Pages* → *Run workflow* on `main`. A `workflow_dispatch` does not
  trigger the Jekyll builder, so the redeploy is uncontested.
- **Enforce HTTPS** should stay ticked. It was off for a period, and
  `http://advadiityagade.com/` answered `200` with no redirect to TLS.

## 1. One-time provisioning

### 1.1 Pick a VPS

Hetzner CCX23 or equivalent (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, NVMe, ~€30/mo) running **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**. Single region: choose one near your users — `fsn1` (Frankfurt) or `hel1` (Helsinki) for the EU; AWS Mumbai (`ap-south-1`) class machine if you need India proximity.

### 1.2 Domain + DNS

Register a domain (Cloudflare Registrar, Porkbun, etc.). Create five **A records** pointing to the VPS IPv4:

| Subdomain | Service |
|---|---|
| `app.<domain>` | ag-platform (LegalTech UI) |
| `dashboard.<domain>` | AI workflow dashboard |
| `api.<domain>` | FastAPI agents |
| `n8n.<domain>` | n8n orchestrator |
| `docs.<domain>` | Static docs site |

If you front Cloudflare, set proxy to **DNS-only (gray cloud)** for the initial Let's Encrypt handshake — switch to proxied after the first cert issues.

### 1.3 Supabase Cloud project

1. Create a free-tier project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com). Region: `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) for Indian banking compliance, or your nearest region otherwise.
2. **SQL Editor** → run `ag-platform/src/server/migrations.sql` (cases, profiles, timesheets, organizations tables).
3. **Database → Extensions** → enable `pgvector` (not strictly required for Supabase since the on-VPS Postgres handles embeddings, but useful if you later migrate).
4. **Authentication → Providers** → enable Email (magic links). Add `https://app.<domain>` to the allowed redirect URLs.
5. Copy **Project URL**, **anon key**, **service_role key**, and **JWT Secret** (Settings → API). These go into `/srv/ag/.env` on the VPS.

### 1.4 LLM provider

Default: **Groq free tier** (`llama-3.1-70b-versatile`, OpenAI-compatible). Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com), create an API key. Or use Gemini via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint — set `LLM_BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` and provide your Gemini key.

### 1.5 Bootstrap the VPS

SSH in as root, then:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LUXORANOVA9/AGASSOCIATES/main/scripts/bootstrap-vps.sh | bash
```

This installs Docker, hardens the firewall (ufw + fail2ban), creates a `deploy` user, clones the repo to `/srv/ag/repo`, and seeds `/srv/ag/.env` from the template. Read the on-screen "Next steps" the script prints when it finishes.

### 1.6 Fill in secrets

Edit `/srv/ag/.env` (mode 0600, owner `deploy`) and replace every `REPLACE_WITH_*` value. Generate strong secrets with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Generate the n8n basic-auth password hash with:

```bash
docker run --rm caddy:2 caddy hash-password --plaintext 'your-n8n-password'
```

### 1.7 First boot

As the `deploy` user:

```bash
cd /srv/ag/repo
docker compose --env-file /srv/ag/.env up -d --build
docker compose --env-file /srv/ag/.env logs -f
```

> **Why `cd /srv/ag/repo`?** Compose resolves relative build contexts (e.g.
> `./ag-platform`, `./ag-associates-ai/backend`,
> `./ag-associates-ai/database/init.sql`) from the parent of the first
> compose file. Running compose from anywhere else would fail with
> "build context not found".

Caddy will request Let's Encrypt certs for all five hostnames. First boot takes ~3 minutes (Sentence-Transformer model download is baked into the image so /api/generate-agreement is fast on first hit).

### 1.8 Seed RAG templates

```bash
docker compose --env-file /srv/ag/.env exec ai-backend python generate_embeddings.py
```

This populates the `vector(384)` column in the `legal_templates` table for the three seeded Maharashtra rent agreement templates.

## 2. Smoke tests

Run from your laptop. All must pass before declaring launch:

```bash
DOMAIN=agassociates.example.com

dig +short app.$DOMAIN dashboard.$DOMAIN api.$DOMAIN n8n.$DOMAIN docs.$DOMAIN
# → all five must resolve to the VPS IP

curl -sf https://api.$DOMAIN/health
# → {"status":"ok"}

curl -sf -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://dashboard.$DOMAIN
# → 200

curl -sfu admin:$N8N_PASS https://n8n.$DOMAIN/ -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
# → 200

curl -sf https://docs.$DOMAIN/quickstart -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
# → 200

# End-to-end agent run:
curl -sf -X POST https://api.$DOMAIN/api/generate-agreement \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"raw_input":"Rental agreement between Ramesh and Suresh for ₹15000/month at 12 MG Road, Thane."}'
# → JSON with success:true and a PDF path
```

In the browser, open `https://app.$DOMAIN`, sign in via magic link, create a case scoped to `bank=ICICI`. Sign out, sign in as a user from a different bank; confirm the ICICI case is NOT visible (RLS check).

---

## 3. Continuous deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `main` that touches code:

1. Builds three images: `ag-ai-backend`, `ag-ai-dashboard`, `ag-platform`. Pushes to `ghcr.io/luxoranova9/<name>:latest` and `:<sha>`.
2. SSHes into the VPS as `deploy`, pulls the new images, `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans`.
3. Smoke-tests `https://api.<domain>/health` — fails the workflow if non-200.

Required **repo secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `VPS_HOST` | VPS public IP or hostname |
| `VPS_USER` | `deploy` |
| `VPS_SSH_KEY` | Private half of the SSH key you pasted into `/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys` |
| `VPS_PORT` | `22` (or your custom port) |
| `PROD_DOMAIN` | e.g. `agassociates.example.com` |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key (baked into ag-platform browser bundle at build time) |

Required **repo variables** (same page, "Variables" tab):

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL (also build-baked into ag-platform) |

> **Why both vars and secrets?** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and `VITE_*` env vars are inlined into the browser JS bundle at `docker build` time — they cannot be supplied at container start. CI must pass them as `--build-arg` to `docker build`. Repo Variables hold non-sensitive URLs; Secrets hold the anon key (which is technically public but kept in Secrets for rotation hygiene).

The `clerk-docs` repo has its own `deploy.yml` that builds the static site with Bun and rsyncs `dist/` into `/srv/ag/clerk-docs/dist` on the VPS. Caddy serves it directly — no container rebuild needed.

### Rollback

Pin the previous SHA in `/srv/ag/.env`:

```bash
echo "IMAGE_TAG=<previous-sha>" >> /srv/ag/.env
cd /srv/ag/repo
docker compose --env-file /srv/ag/.env pull
docker compose --env-file /srv/ag/.env up -d
```

Remove the override once verified.

---

## 4. Backups & restore

Nightly cron (`/etc/cron.d/ag-backup`, installed by `bootstrap-vps.sh`) runs `scripts/backup.sh`:

- `pg_dumpall` of the on-VPS Postgres (legal_templates + n8n DBs)
- `tar.gz` of `n8n_data` and `ag_output` Docker volumes
- All staged into a temp dir, then `restic backup` to Backblaze B2 (or Hetzner Storage Box)
- Retention: 7 daily / 4 weekly / 6 monthly

**Restore drill** — practice this monthly:

```bash
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=b2:ag-backups:/agassociates RESTIC_PASSWORD=…
restic snapshots
restic restore latest --target ./restore
docker exec -i ag_postgres psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d postgres < ./restore/tmp.*/postgres-*.sql.gz
```

Supabase Cloud has its own automated daily backups (Pro tier) — on free tier, use the dashboard to export `cases` and `profiles` weekly.

---

## 5. Observability (minimum viable)

- **Uptime:** UptimeRobot free tier — one monitor per subdomain, 5-minute interval, alert to email + Slack incoming webhook.
- **Logs:** `docker compose logs -f --tail=200 <service>` for now. Phase 2: add `grafana/loki` + `promtail` containers.
- **Errors:** populate `SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND` and `SENTRY_DSN_PLATFORM` in `.env` to wire up Sentry. Leave blank to disable.

---

## 6. Day-2 operations

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Tail backend logs | `docker compose logs -f ai-backend` |
| Restart one service | `docker compose restart ag-platform` |
| Apply DB migrations after schema change | `docker compose exec postgres psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` |
| Re-seed RAG templates | `docker compose exec ai-backend python generate_embeddings.py` |
| Rotate a secret | edit `/srv/ag/.env`, then `cd /srv/ag/repo && docker compose --env-file /srv/ag/.env up -d` |
| See Caddy's certificate state | `docker compose exec caddy ls /data/caddy/certificates` |

---

## 7. NeSL integration (deferred)

The mock `/api/nesl/execute` endpoint returns a stub transaction ID. To wire up real Government NeSL filing:

1. Acquire NeSL API credentials and the corporate DSC.
2. Store the DSC in **Hashicorp Vault** or a separate sealed volume on the VPS — NOT in `.env`.
3. Update `main.py` `/api/nesl/execute` with the official SOAP/JSON payloads.
4. Add a network egress allowlist for the NeSL endpoint.

---

## Appendix A — Alternative: managed cloud (Supabase + Cloud Run + Vercel)

Use this path when you cross ~1k concurrent users or need multi-region HA. Original 72-hour-sprint checklist:

1. **Database & Auth (Supabase):** create production project; run `ag-platform/src/server/migrations.sql`; enable `pgvector`; configure providers.
2. **AI Backend on Google Cloud Run:** `docker build -t gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/ag-ai-backend ./ag-associates-ai/backend`, push, deploy with the env vars from `.env.production.example` (DATABASE_URL pointing at Supabase, SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET, LLM_BASE_URL, CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS).
3. **Frontend on Vercel/Cloudflare Pages:** point at `ag-platform/`, set `VITE_*` env vars; for the AI dashboard point at `ag-associates-ai/frontend/`.
4. **n8n:** deploy as a Cloud Run job or use n8n Cloud; update HTTP Request nodes to `https://<backend-url>/api/...`.
5. **Pre-flight:** JWT bridge test, offline-queue test on the Field App, WhatsApp webhook handshake to n8n.

This is the path documented in earlier revisions of this file; it's preserved here for reference.
