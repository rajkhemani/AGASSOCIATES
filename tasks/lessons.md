# Lessons Learned

## Bug Patterns

- **`register_vector()` must receive a connection**: Calling `register_vector()` with no args (or at module level before any connection exists) causes `TypeError`. Always: connect first → `register_vector(conn)` → then query.

- **Never clear `state['errors']` on success**: Agent nodes were resetting `state['errors'] = []` when they succeeded, wiping errors from previous nodes. Errors must persist through the entire pipeline execution.

- **Embedding dimension must be consistent in 3 places**: `config.py` (`EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`), `database/init.sql` (`vector(N)`), and `.env.example`. Changing one without the others causes silent RAG failures or INSERT errors.

- **Use portable paths, not hardcoded OS paths**: `OUTPUT_DIR` was hardcoded to `/workspace/ag-associates-ai/output/` (Linux-only). Use `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "output")` for cross-platform compatibility.

- **Always `try/finally` for database connections**: Any endpoint that opens a DB connection must close it in a `finally` block — even if an exception occurs. Without this, connections leak under error conditions.

## Process Patterns

- **Don't push directly to main**: Create a feature branch (`fix/...`, `feat/...`, `docs/...`) and open a PR. This creates an audit trail and allows review.

- **Backtest after every change batch**: Run validation checks across all modified files before committing — dimension alignment, import usage, config consistency. Catching bugs in bulk is cheaper than fixing them one at a time.

- **Documentation paths go stale**: Markdown docs (LANGGRAPH_AGENTS.md, DAY3_COMPLETE.md) referenced `/workspace/` paths and old dependency versions. Always update docs alongside code changes.

- **Git must be in system PATH before Antigravity starts**: `setx /M` only affects new processes. If Antigravity was running when PATH was updated, it won't see `git` until restarted.

- **AccountantAgent Security**: Implementation must match tests. Security features like file size limits, magic byte validation, and text sanitization should be moved to a shared extraction method (`extract_text_from_pdf`) and verified via unit tests.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always use `try...finally` blocks for database connections and cursors in long-running scripts (like `generate_embeddings.py`) to prevent connection leaks during errors.
